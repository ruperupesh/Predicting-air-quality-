    Air pollution is a growing environmental and health concern globally. Accurate and timely prediction of air quality can help mitigate its harmful effects and inform policy decisions. This project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to predict air quality based on environmental and meteorological data. By analyzing pollutant concentrations (like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc.), weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind), and geographical location, the model aims to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) or pollutant levels for a given area.

The project involves collecting and preprocessing multi-source data, engineering relevant features, and training machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM networks. The outcome provides actionable insights into pollution trends, helping authorities issue health advisories, optimize pollution control, and raise environmental awareness.
